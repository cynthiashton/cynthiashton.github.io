<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Descriptions:&nbsp;</strong> In this section you will find detail information and artifacts as my values as a person, my skills that I have developed, and my leadership skills that have been practiced.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Reflection:</strong> Throughout my life I have volunteered within my local communities and I have the privilege to experience multiply different fields of services. In more recent years I've done service works through internships and student activist groups. Through these outlets as well as classroom knowledge and working with others I had developed values and skills, which refine my passion and shape the areas I am most successful with. In this section you will find a brief explanation of some of these values and skills are.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div></div><div class="textblock"></div><div class="textblock"></div></div></div></article><article role="article"><div class="content Basic  formId_Basic contentId_aaaea99a-cfed-494a-a1cc-7abbc91429c4 pageContentId_18580e6f-e0bd-475f-8cfd-abbeb2792831" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Thing"><link itemprop="url" href="http://cynthiaashton.myefolio.com/valueskill/aaaea99a-cfed-494a-a1cc-7abbc91429c4"><input class="hiddenContentFormId" value="Basic" type="hidden"><h2 class="field contentTitle " itemprop="name"><span class="value">Personal Skills</span></h2><div class="contentBody"><div class="field description Textarea"><div class="value">
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">During my life I have been involved with multiple activities which have shaped and defined my personal skills. Through these experiences of work, internships, volunteer, work and extracurricular activities I have gained skills that help me achieve success.<br>
</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Leadership:</span><br>
 <span style="font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I have developed my leadership through volunteer, school and work. I have the ability to take charge and focus on specific projects and get things done. An undocumented student expressed that we need our University President to write a letter to our political officials expressing support for the Dream Act. After the conversation with the President I followed through to make sure the letter was written and sent. I am always willing to take the risk and to challenge the norms of practice and explore alternate options. I also reflect on my actions that I've taken and examine areas that were well and areas that weren't and see how I can make it better.</span><br>
<br>
 <span style="font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Bilingualism:</span><br>
 <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">I grew up speaking both Japanese and English. When I worked at Daiso, a Japanese $1.50 store, the manager made me Lead Sales Associate because I spoke proper Japanese and I was able to translate and read the paper work and products in the store. I act as a translator for mother since I was a child. I also used my bilingual skills during my time as a Resident Assistant at J F Oberlin's Fuchinobe International House. &nbsp;In recent years, I act as a&nbsp;translator when volunteering for Japanese American events such as hosting The Northern Californian Cherry Blossom Festival of San Francisco's Cultural Event stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
 <span style="font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Strong Work Ethic:</span><br>
 <span style="font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I am a dedicated worker, if I am given a task I will do my absolute best. Since I was 13 I began to help my mother clean homes. She is a house cleaner, and she taught me on how to do things perfectly. When I cleaned homes for her I worked in good spirits. The attitude you have when you are working on a task reflects how well the job is done. I know I cannot be perfect but I will do my best to do things as ethnically correct as possible.&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
 <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Handles Peoples Relationships Well: It is very important to me to build professional relationships with my co-workers and superiors. I will show the uttermost respect and politeness to all people, and I will be a positive reinforcement. I supported my teammates in Cross Country during my high school years because running is a painful sport so I would cheer on my team mates. My team mate's successes were my successes because I grew pride for my team mates. In more recent years, I practiced the importance of problem solving conflicts with&nbsp;colleagues&nbsp;or professors&nbsp;or bosses. I&nbsp;approach&nbsp;the issue as&nbsp;calmly&nbsp;as possible and do my&nbsp;best&nbsp;to respect and listen to others to better understand the&nbsp;situation. I understand that it takes two to misunderstand or create a problem and it also takes two to solve a misunderstanding or issue.&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
 <span style="font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Teaching:</span><br>
 <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">I am very good at explaining things carefully and descriptively. The president of Variations Club at SF State is planning to expand his organization. I taught him the ideal way of forming committees and officers who will be in charge of those committees to have his organization effective and focused. I worked as a tutor for Lakeshore Elementary School where I made weekly lesson plans based on reading levels for two 3rd grade students. I also&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;Running Records and create integrated art&nbsp;activities.&nbsp;</span></p>
</div></div><div class="textblock"></div><div class="textblock"></div></div></div></article><article role="article"><div class="content Basic  formId_Basic contentId_8ba67449-4bde-4a8f-838d-d6a6038b1ff5 pageContentId_ae9bc3de-b7ce-4b8b-aed2-b97917fbc386" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Thing"><link itemprop="url" href="http://cynthiaashton.myefolio.com/valueskill/8ba67449-4bde-4a8f-838d-d6a6038b1ff5"><input class="hiddenContentFormId" value="Basic" type="hidden"><h2 class="field contentTitle " itemprop="name"><span class="value">Personal Values</span></h2><div class="contentBody"><div class="field description Textarea"><div class="value">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Values are a continual process constantly being modified due to the experiences that birth new perspectives that are now evolving into professional perspectives of how to incorporate my values with my aspiring areas of work. Through school, work, volunteering and other communal experiences I have developed values. These values are the foundation of the platform for my passion.</p>

<p>Passionate &amp; Hopeful: Throughout my lifetime I have experienced my share of struggle and joy. I realized that the choices a person makes is of their own will, so one should be enthusiastic about what they have chosen. This realization drives me to perform at my best. Of all of the struggles I have experienced, I have learned that you can always take action to move forward. I have hope and faith that things will always work out and get better.</p>

<p>Serving the Local Community: I carry great compassion for those who are oppressed. I have always wanted to help others and make a difference in people's lives in many ways. I believe the best place to start is my surrounding environment. Creating programs and services that will provide a communal atmosphere can help people feel a sense of belonging. I want to develop safe neighborhoods and neighborhood gardens to bring the community together.</p>

<p>Continual Growth of Knowledge: Through college many beauties of the world have been revealed to me which created this curiosity of learning more. I believe that education helps us see different perspectives of the world, which will give us a better understanding of life.</p>

<p>Work in social service/education: As a result of my observations through life and volunteering, I developed a passion towards the enrichment of the lives of children. If a child at a young age learns to love learning, I believe that the communities we develop will improve. I would like to have a job working with children, and instilling the importance of growth, adventure, and education. One can never stop learning about the world and people.</p>

<p>Impact Policy Changes: I would like to pursue elementary teaching. The prime reason why I want to work with children is that I would like to implement the understanding to children that we speak many different types of English. When I was in elementary school I was told at a young age that my English was poor. Because of that throughout my academia I believed that I was a bad student and I didn't understand English well. Through my studies I discovered that there are many different types of English. There is one used through academia, and another that is used in conversation. One's ethnic background plays a large roll of what slurs one's tongue prefer.&nbsp; 40% of 5 year-old children in America are bilingual. I would like to work towards the efforts of improving the quality of education and providing programs and services for all types of students.I would like to implement improvement of the standards for bilingual children. To provide a high quality of bilingual programs and services to aid the children of immigrant parents.</p>

<p>Compassion: All of the values I have is because I have great compassion for people. I believe that positive energy is reflected through people, and if you treat yourself well you will treat others around you just as well. Loving one's self is the first step to loving the environment you live in.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In this section you will find examples of my abilities of my skills beyond volunteer, work, and school. The experiences gained from my past jobs immensely contributed to the person I am today. Through these activities I gained a better insight of how the world works and how to interact with people in it. I hope to continue reflecting on the experiences and also hope to have more experiences to reflect upon.<br>

 <strong>JACL ( Japanese American Citizen League) Eden C Girls Basketball Team Assistant Coach</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br>
 Through the JACL I volunteered to be an assistant coach for the 7th and 8th grade team by recommendation of the coach. I attended regular practices every Friday, and went to games on weekends and tournaments. I worked closely with the girls on refining basketball skills along with boosting their self-confidence. The most important thing about playing basketball was having fun. I developed relationships not only with the girls but with their parents who often got "too into the game' which caused the girls to feel pressured. I developed better understanding among the parents and the players. I also played as a caretaker for the girls as the parents went out in the evenings during the tournaments.<br>
</span><br>
 <strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Japanese Student Association Active Member</span></strong></p>

<p><br>
 <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">At SF State there is a Japanese Student Association (JSA)</span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">where they throw BBQ parties, language exchange sessions, cultural events, career symposiums, and many other services for Japanese students and students who are interested in Japanese culture. I have been involved in the organization since my freshman year and I have learn to help give perspectives of the services they provide our students. One of the biggest parties the JSA throws every year is the International Halloween Party. I helped organize, plan and host the event.</span></p>

<p><br>
 <strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Associated Students Incorporated Student Government President</span></strong></p>

<p><br>
 <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Associated Students Inc. is a non-profit organization funded by student fees that provides programs and services such as, Women Center, Education Referral Organization for Sexuality, Legal Resources, Farmers Market, Performing Arts &amp; Lectures, Project Connect and Project Rebound in the efforts of stimulating the college experience. In my position as chair of the Board of Directors, I am held responsible for ensuring the smooth operation, accountability and representation of the student body and work towards efforts of student-related concerns, polices and services. Through ASI I have gained improvement of my communication skills and leadership skills. I have learned to listen and respond quickly and effectively. I use my power to help the common student and I am working towards uplifting students to their full potential of success here at SF State.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">J F Oberlin University's Fuchinobe International House: Residence Assistant</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">During my year abroad at J F Oberlin&nbsp;University&nbsp;in&nbsp;Machida, Tokyo, Japan I lived in the Fuchinobe International House dormitory. During my stay there, I applied to become a Resident Assistance. Only 8 students were selected to serve the 300 residence who lived in the dormitory. I was selected and appointed chair/coordinator of monthly cultural events which showcased student's home countries and their culture. I acted as a liaison to J F Oberlin&nbsp;University, a&nbsp;translator, and fostered dorm community.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Intercultural Teaching&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I have faced challenges in intercultural teaching that I overcame through persistence and perseverance. One example of the many cross-cultural experiences was during my time as a study abroad student at J. F. Oberlin University. &nbsp;I taught English as a foreign language at a local conversation school. There I met Manato, the biggest troublemaker who would disrupt class and refuse to participate in reading, writing, and classroom activities. After three months of gaining Manato's respect through patience and kindness in sharing American culture, he suddenly saved me a seat on the "magic" carpet and began to participate in class. Because of my guidance he was eager to learn American culture and language. I began to understand his learning abilities, identify his challenges, and his successes. I realize how meaningful and rewarding it is to participate in cultural exchange and the need for constant improvement as a teacher to help children succeed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As of right now, I tutor 3rd graders in reading comprehension and writing which motivates me to build upon my teaching and leadership skills. I learned that a teacher must alter teaching methods and strategies depending on the students' needs. Because of my tutoring experience at America Reads, I learned to problem solve by using different strategies and observe which method fits best for my tutee.&nbsp;</span></p>

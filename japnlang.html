<p>As the youngest in my family, I did not have the heart to leave my single mother. I made a decision to stay in the San Francisco Bay Area in order to take care of her. My mother immigrated in 1979 and still have difficulties with English. I translate and help her with obtaining social services and resources. In late 2010, my mother told me I can move out only if I moved to study abroad in Japan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In September 2011, I began my solitary life style in the Fuchinobe International House where I was selected as a Residence Assistant. My purpose of my study abroad experience was to educate myself with Japanese language, communication, history, folklore, and literature. I worked part-time at an English Conversational school which I was lead teacher in a low teacher student ratio class. I studied at J F Oberlin until August 2012. From this experience I picked up the Japanese minor.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Artifact: Participation in showcasing J F Oberlin</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Description: This is a description&nbsp; of the Chapel, showcasing J F Oberlin University's campus (in Japanese).&nbsp;</p>

<p>桜美林のチャプレン室というのは「学校付きの牧師のこと」だと言われています。つまり「牧師の部屋」とも呼ばれています。桜美林の学生に対して、チャプレン室は学園の建学精神・キリスト教教育生活などを通して、皆の学生生活を支援するごとを目的としています。</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>チャペルが好きな理由は、色々あります。その中の一つは屋根のことです。屋根から桜美林大学全体が見渡せて桜の木も綺麗によく見えます。チャペルの十字架も見えてとてもかっこいいです。桜美林大学はやはりキリスト教の大学なのだと思わされます。</p>

<p>そして、もう一つは地下のことです。地下には小ホールがあり、桜美林の色々なイベントで使用しています。小ホールの廊下の壁には桜美林学生の絵が展示されています。廊下のとなりにはラウンジのようなところがあり、そこはとても静かで中には勉強している人がいます。この部屋には机があり、本棚があり自由に本を読めます。一番いいのがピアノが置いてあることです。ピアノを弾くのが上手な学生がよくひいています。勉強にはすごくいいクラシック音楽を聞くと落ち着きます。誰もいない時は、友達と遊んでピアノを弾きます。このラウンジにも色々な絵が展示されています。一番感動したのは、秋学期に見た津波の救援活動の出展です。この作品は、桜美林学生が見せてくれました。</p>

<p>Reflection: This was a very good project because this composition is printed in &nbsp;featured in J F Oberlin's international student showcasing magazine. From this assignment I learn composed a audience base writing skill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Description: This course gives students an opportunity to enter into the dynamics of Japanese cinema. Engaging Japanese films from important directors across time periods and various genres, it will focus on the relationship between film and culture.</p>

<p>Reflection: This course dealt with many disciplines in regards to the category of the humanities within a Japanese societal lens. Japanese Cinema is radical and critical of Japanese society and it's issues in regards to basic human rights and social inequities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Description: Reflections of Japanese cinema and a analysis of the heart and the dynamic development of Japanese culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Cinema: Term Paper</p>

<p>Section 1:</p>

<p>My whole life I grew up with a mixture of American culture, Japanese-American culture, and Japanese culture. In my lifetime I have been to Japan 14 times. I often experienced culture shock, so much that it was almost natural to me. I always had much knowledge regarding Japanese culture yet I never truly understood it completely. Taking the Japanese Cinema course at J F Oberlin University transformed my understanding of Japanese culture, society and most importantly the art and beauty of it. From this course I gained a better understanding of the societal structure in which the cultural concept of <em>giri</em> is based<em>,</em> which is intertwined in human emotion. <em>Giri</em> is the concept in which relationships are tied with responsibilities depending on the status of the persons of the relationship. Like all cultures, Japanese culture is dynamic and unique in the structure of relationships. However, unlike other cultures, Japan seems to have an aspect of specific and inflexible relationship structure. Japan is full of these relationships, which are tied together with responsibilities. For example relationships between the family, friends, co-workers, and relatives. These structures take into account both vertical and horizontal type relationships, seeing both how individuals relate to one's self above, below and as a peer, setting specific rules which govern interactions. Kurosawa's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thrown of Blood</span> displayed feudal Japan and more so the art of the warrior spirit. Mizoguchi's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sisters of Gion</span> expressed the battle between traditional and modern individual concepts. The development of characters in Ozu's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Equinox Flower</span> shows the family dynamics of Japan. Finally after all the years of observing Japanese culture</p>

<p>In general, all of the films grasped at many aspects of Japanese culture, society and art. Perhaps it may be because I am not a true film critic that I never deeply analyzed or critically view films. From our class discussion and from critically attempting to comprehend the director's motives and messages within the film, I now feel that I am closer to Japanese society than ever before. The humane sympathy and the expression of art are nothing like the American Hollywood films. When I was a child I always accepted Japanese culture and society as it was. Within my college years I began to question Japan and now after my studies here at J F Oberlin I feel that I have come to a deep understanding of the scars and beauty of Japan. Japanese Cinema truly is an art form which.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Section2:</p>

<p>Japanese films are far from the Hollywood cinemas. Many directors disregard the rules of Hollywood and do what they please. Within the films, the themes are relate-able to anyone around the world, yet the artistic portrayals of the films are very Japanese which makes it pleasing to a worldwide audience. One topic which is possibly the most difficult to comprehend within Japanese cinema is the display of the society. Perhaps it is because Japanese society is incomparable to any other because of the rapid transformation of the society. Japan's society is an odd mixture of feudal, modern, and postmodern concepts, ideals, and practice. Through the progression of Japanese cinema, the progression of the Japanese society can also be seen. In my opinion, throughout Japanese cinema is a portrayal of strong opinionated societal concerns, yet the Japanese audience cannot grasp the message given by the director.</p>

<p>In Akira Kurosawa's <em>jidaigeki</em> film of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thrown of Blood</span> is Kurosawa's adaptation of Shakespeare's play of Macbeth. This <em>jidaigeki</em> film beautifully displays the violent feudal warriors of Japan. Like all countries, Japan too experienced much civil war among warrior clans; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thrown of Blood</span> gives a glimpse of the tragic violence of the feudal era of Japan. In the opening scene scrolls through the foggy forest as a <em>noh</em> like song sings, "lead ambition to kill, kill by ambition" in which is the exact theme for the film, respectfully reflective of the play of Macbeth. The general portrayal of Japanese society is the feudal wartime. The forest is the grave for many warriors who lost their lives in battle for their clan. In my opinion the scene in which Washizu and Miki meets the ghost of the forest beautifully displayed the spiritual and superstitious beliefs of the ancient Japanese. The Noh like expressions of the music and with the demented Lady Asaji truly gave the authentic Japanese-ness, which makes it very enjoyable to the audience. The overall message of the film is the vanity of the ambition for violence. When thinking of the over message in which is basically the same as Shakespeare's Macbeth; makes me truly believe that man-kind has yet to learn the vanity of the ambitious violence in war. As for present much war is still ongoing. Throne of Blood was released into theaters in 1957; Kurosawa made a jidaigeki film after the imperialist Japan. I am not very knowledgeable with Shakespeare, let along the play of Macbeth, but in my opinion Kurosawa beautifully illustrated samurai warrior film is the true sincerity of the vanity of war portrayed with feudal Japan. Perhaps this could be also could be interpreted as the source of Japan's imperial regime.</p>

<p>In Yusijiro Ozu's <em>gendai-geki</em> film of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Equinox Flower</span> shows the Japanese family structure along with gender relationships and generation differences. Any family around the globe can relate to the desires of love yet the necessary need of approval from the parents. The theme of family drama and the revolution of relationships are careful painted out with the heavy concept of <em>amae</em>. According to Doi Takeo the concepts of <em>amae</em> is the dependence on benevolence relationship, which is also co-dependent, along with allowing children to indulge in certain behavior (Class notes May 5, 2012). Perhaps this is critique of the loss of discipline due to consumerism; one in which displays the generational differences within the family very distinct. Ozu's shooting of the tatami angels reminds one of sitting on the tatami floor at the dining table, giving a family feel. The ties of family and friends give strong concerns of the battle of tradition and modernity. The general changes of the Japanese society are that now daughters have the freedom to pick one's spouse based on desire and love. Overall the general message of the film is the elegant realistic daily lives of the Hirayama family and the drama of letting go of their daughter to marriage. In my opinion, this is another concept that is still very relatable to today, specifically regarding the gender relationships, generation differences and love. This film was released in 1958, which is one year after Kurosawa's Thrown of Blood. In my opinion this is very reflective of the Japanese societal shift between traditional and modern; displaying not only the large gaps between generations but the large gaps within the progression of the society. While modernity influences with such a rapid speed, many traditional concepts are completely ignored or completed latched onto a modern one.</p>

<p>In Takeshi Kitano's <em>genda-geki</em> film, of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kids Return</span> displays the restless rebellious youth of modern day Japan. The film shows parallels of high schoolers moving onto adulthood and their struggle with finding their belonging within the constraining society. Takeshi beautiful illustrated the lost generation whom has little inspiration because of the lack of guidance and role models. The societal atmosphere within the film gives a strong sense of order and conforming to societal rules. Those who do not conform to the societal rules are alienated. Not one of the adults within the film ever gave advice of how to go about finding a belonging within society. Perhaps Takeshi is critiquing the set tracks of life drawn out by society giving little to no freedom. The overall message is displayed within the repetition of trying to find a place to belong to within society. When thinking of the message of the film, I agree with Takeshi that growing into adulthood in Japan is challenging for it give very little opportunity to let one freely choose what to do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Japanese cinema is such a form of revelatory art that I have grown to better understand a culture, which pervades much of my multicultural influenced life. Even though society depicted by Japanese Cinema is one of the most difficult aspects of Japanese Cinema to grasp even for the Japanese audience, through these cinematic descriptions of Japanese societal concerns and progress, the issues within Japanese society and the Japanese dynamics intertwined among feudal, modern, and postmodern culture can be seen. One thought to consider about Japanese society depicted within these films is the displayed contradiction among Japanese societal rules which gives Japan structure yet limits an individual, such as in <em>Giri,</em> with relationships. Hopeful thoughts lean on the idea of more Japanese individuals and individuals throughout the world viewing Japanese cinema with an eye for societal comprehension, tying (without neglecting) crucial Japanese history and culture to a future of true, honest and clear relationships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reflections: This paper is my final comprehensible statement of Japanese cinema with it's complexity due to multiple aspects of society.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Reflection: This course solved all the&nbsp;mysterious&nbsp;and question I had&nbsp;about Japanese folklore. Growing up in a Japanese home and visiting my relatives in Japan constantly, I was always exposed to Japanese folklore but was never given much&nbsp;explanation. This course exposed and revealed with academic evidence of Japanese folklore. The course is&nbsp;interdisciplinary in regards to Japanese classics,&nbsp;&nbsp;folklore, music art, religion, creation myths, and culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Artifact: I do not have any artifacts for this course all which were hand written assignments only, heavy reading, and exams.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Description: The objectives of the course are to assist students in understanding what is happening in Japan and what makes Japan tick. We will cover all areas of Japan and her people, including but not limited to politics, business, social matters, show biz, sports, etc.</span></p>

<p><span>Reflection: I really appreciated Professor Morohoshi for being open-minded to our opinions and also provided scholarly&nbsp;evidence&nbsp;of why the current societal climate of Japan. This course was very informational and help me gain a better&nbsp;understanding&nbsp;of Japanese politics.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Artifact: For this course, student had to write a weekly paper of a news article. This is my paper on bullying in Japan.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Bullying, child abuse at record high</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Post Date: March 3, 2012 Author: Kyodo</p>

<p>Nationwide 3,306 bullying cases at schools last year, a rise of 21.8 percent from the previous year said Friday by the Justice Ministry. Cases of child abuse also reached a record with 865 cases, a rise of 12.2 percent. Some cases are children victims of the disaster who were forced into different schools. On Friday the cabinet approved a bill introducing monitor juvenile reformatories by third parties allowing the inmates to have more contact to the outside world. Giving detainees more leeway to phones and sending letters. The bill gives detainees the option to file with the justice minister if they are dissatisfied with their treatment. &nbsp;This proposal aims to prevent abuse by reformatory officials. If passed by the Diet, it would be the first change to the juvenile training school act since it came into force in 1949. According to Children Rights International Network, bully-related complaints increased by more than 50% perform from 2009. Sexual abuse cases of junior high school girls have now also surfaced to the Ministry of Legal Affairs. Cases may of increased because more people especially children are aware that legal affairs bureaus are providing consultation services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My siblings and I all have been bullied ever since we can recall social interactions, because of that we often take the lead on standing up for the little guy. Perhaps the militant nationalism of the Meiji era promoted their Confucianism style of teaching of obedience and the idea of keeping of harmony or peace. &nbsp;This may be why when a child witnesses another getting bullied to not get involved. If so, pick the bully's side in order to maintain the peace relations. This bullying issue will not change unless the Education Ministry takes lead on progressing education as a collective along with an individualistic value approach. Yet, this is a huge task to achieve for the history of the Japanese have a heavily collective mentality. Perhaps this may be why as an individual Japanese are so weak, and those who are strong are looked down upon. The Japanese government is making some progress for are identifying the issues along with providing aid.</p>

<p><span>Description: This course will introduce students to Japanese experience of modernity expressed in personal narratives, a special type of literature. These narratives, including memoirs, autobiographies, letters and personal essays, provide uniquely personal ways of understanding Japan. The readings will focus on Japan's change from a feudal society into an industrialized nation. The themes will include the Meiji restoration, the war, women's position, social class, minorities, subculture and other aspects of Japan. Discussions will compare and contrast the many different views of Japan to understand the larger themes from the personal point of view.</span></p>

<p><span>Reflection: This class consisted of Professor Lisa Li, Takako (Japanese student), and myself. The course was more of a women's book club with essays, full of discussions. This course is&nbsp;interdisciplinary approach liberated our minds from learning from rich Japanese literature.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Artifact: This is my final paper for this course, it is an a<span>nalysis of femininity within modern literature and reflections to Japanese societies.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Females and Japan</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing up as a Japanese and American I was always questioned about my identity. Although it was very clear to me who I am, society's constant pressures of which category I choose brought question to my identity. Since I grew up mostly in America with an American education I lacked in Japanese knowledge. As a result I decided to move to Japan and study thoroughly of the Japanese language, culture, history, and society. Taking this Modern Japanese Literature course brought me into a deeper understanding of Japan and its development. Even though I knew of modern day Japan, I didn't understand the process of its history which made it what it is today. Through autobiographies, memoirs, and life writings I began to comprehend the patriarchal society along with extreme female issues.&nbsp; Even though the Meiji era introduced the concepts of rights, the gender roles maintain feudal thinking due to the twenty six hundred years of traditional customs. Female issues are deeply rooted from the Eastern Asian and feudal traditions. Salvation for women was neglected throughout the development of Japan from the Meiji era.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Japanese language itself preserves the traditional values of feudalism.&nbsp; Separated into masculine and feminine forms of vocabulary, the language is reflected of the culture. Often times, people tell me that I do not speak o<em>nnarashii</em> because of the way I say "you" or "I".&nbsp; Till this day the separation of speech is used within today's society and the people of Japan see nothing sexist about it. The separation of speech by male and female reflects the societal values of collectivism. By separating creates a group identity. This is frequently done within Japanese society with class status, region, religious cults, schooling, companies, et cetera. Separation of genders is still practice in Eastern cultures. This is why the language, education, society status, and everything that comes with culture is framed with the Eastern perspective of division of the sexes. The education is separated from feudal times, which framed the status in women.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;<em>The Great Learning for Women</em> restrained women suffrage and the status of Japanese women. <em>The Great Learning for Women</em>, also known as <em>Onna Daigaku</em>, was written in the mid 16<sup>th</sup> century by Kaibara Ekiken who was strongly influenced by Confucianism beliefs. <em>Onna Daigaku</em> is the education that all Japanese women received since the creation of the book. <em>Onna Daigaku</em> states that "... it is a girl's destiny, on reaching womanhood, to go to a new home and live in submission to her parents-in-law..." (Theodore, 230). It further states that the husband is the woman's lord and he can divorce his wife for seven outrages reasons. Women are inferior to men and it is wrongful "for her [to] by an excess of care [or] to try to attract attention to herself" (Theodore, 233).&nbsp; Apparently women are born with these vicious personalities and must be tamed. Because of this, women pollute men and they must be kept separately. A woman's purpose is to reproduce therefore it is her duty to be educated in becoming a wise wife and good mother. <em>Onna Daigaku</em> institutionalized the belief that women are inferior to men, along with reinforces the insecurities of women, and especially separating males and females.&nbsp; This feudal education created the fountain of the status of women.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The elite started the revolution; the Meiji abandoned some traditions and preserved others. In particularly the status of women went unchanged. Even though the Meiji changed the entire class system, taxation, creation of prefectures and governors, abandonment of swords, increased import/export, many other changes and introduced new philosophies and ways of thinking. With all this change happening, the elite males made the constitution in which: women were prohibited by law to the right to vote, the right to join political parties, and the right on expressing political values. Even though with the concept of rights were being practice the males felt that women are not human. Or so does the constitution reflects, that women are not consider human. The Eastern Asian perspective does not consider it be inhuman to treat women as they have been treated for centuries. Women are used to be the pride of the nation. "Westerners lauding Japanese women's doll-like feminine charms serve as bonds strengthening native weapons of control" (Ishimoto, 278). I agree with Ishimoto that the nation of Japan use women as a symbol of preservation of Japanese culture. Women in Japan experienced especially in marriage.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Japan's concept of marriage built a foundation of inequality. The Eastern Asian perspective of marriage is to preserve status not an acknowledgment of love. "These marriages were arranged primarily for political purposes, interweaving families of wealth and power to enhance glory of to reaffirm steadfast connection" (Ishimoto, 49). When the Western thinking influenced Japan of romance, women began to have an appetite for this enchanted ideology. Within the home women were imprisoned from freedom along with enduring nuisance of concubines. <em>Onna Daigaku</em> states that women wait on hand and foot serving their husbands. "Women were never to go beyond that door except on formal occasions when they received permission" (Ishimoto, 48). Women had no freedom in the house, for the assignments of the days were already decided because of holidays, seasons, or family occasions kept them busy. Wealthy families would be so busy they would have the help of <em>"maids"</em>. The concubines, or maids, were separated into two classifications. &nbsp;"...'the Honorable Pure' and 'the Honorable Impure' were the two classifications into which the young women-in-waiting were divided" (Ishimoto, 48). The pure were untouched by the husband and the impure were the ones who already been touched.&nbsp; Western thinking also started the one husband one wife system. Prior to that politicians like Matsukata Masayoshi had not only just a wife but three concubines (Reischauer, 103). According to <em>Onna Daigaku</em>, women had no right to speak against such animosity. The concubines came from "respectable families, willing to let their daughter assume the secondary role in a more prominent family" (Reischauer, 103). Women were given off to families of wealth who needed more servants in the household. The transformation of the concept of marriage is still in struggle. The practice of concubines may no longer legally be allowed but the practice of sexulization of women is very much alive.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The practice of <em>geisha</em> has transformed into a degretting businesses such as the sex industry, <em>soapland</em>, <em>kyabakura</em>, and even the music industry. Concubines were considered to be higher class then a <em>geisha</em>. "Geisha normally came from impoverished families, which sold them into establishments where they were trained to become professional entertainers" (Reischauer, 102-103). There were geishas who were just entertainers and the lower ranking geishas where prostitutes. Geisha houses are merely just pleasure corners which politicians or respected wealthy men used to hold meetings. This was practice from the 600s, and women "…do not see anything dishonoring in selling themselves into a strange man for money, and the man sees nothing shameful in visiting these pleasure houses, an atmosphere of harmless cheerfulness prevails in these establishments..." (Ishimoto, 238). Perhaps Ishimoto is suggesting this because women do not know better for this is engrained into the Japanese society as acceptable. Because of the prohibitation of political activist of females, it was not until 1957 that prostitution became illegal. Geisha houses existence may only be in Kyoto now. The nation take great pride of these classy entertainers for it has a significant role in their history. Now the sex industry creates outrages forms of pornography, which often is found next to the Disney movies section in Book Off. <em>Soapland</em> is a modern brothel type business which prostitutes engage in sexual activity with their clients. <em>Kyabakura</em> bars, a hostess club where men can drink with the pleasure of conversation with a worker. Even in the music industry girl groups such as AKB48 are hyper sexualized, undergoing plastic surgery to create the perfect girl. I think the reason why women see no inequalities of their gender is because of the societal acceptance and demands.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The poisonous education of <em>Onna Daigaku</em> has polluted the society. <em>Onna Daigaku</em> and the government's belief of women's occupation destiny is be become a "good wife wise mother." Even with Meiji restoration requiring all to attend schooling, the government also created women's college to educate women of "good wife wise mother." Ishimoto states that important educational subjects for women are penmanship, sewing, cooking, and art. This sort of education does not liberate a mind yet just refrain it from any type of progression. This is the soul reason of why women never reach their salvation.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The Eastern perspective influenced Japan's language and feudal traditions which has great restraints for women. The Meiji era flipped Japan upside down along with preserving Japanese-ness, and used women as a symbol of feudal beliefs. Marriages origins in Japan carried great suffering for women as they shared their husbands with concubines. If not shared with concubines, the husbands would go to the red district to receive pleasure from a geisha. The faulty education for women has trapped women from liberation. Since Meiji the role of women has changed but not as progressively as Japan's society. In September I was watching television with my uncle, a special feature about women obtaining jobs usually occupied by men. Women salvation has been delayed because men are in power. Perhaps the women needed individual salvation before making their move in society. Today in Japanese society, I constantly get reminded of what's my role because of my gender. Even though I understand the root of gender specified ideology, it must be the American in me that makes me rebel against such restraints.</p>

<p><span>Description: Grammatical analysis. Rhetoric. Oral and written exercises.<br>
</span></p>

<p><span>Reflection: This course was challenging because of its weekly essays and readings. Professor Minami is a very good at presenting material in a way which&nbsp;engages&nbsp;students.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Artifact: This is an essay in Japanese about the differences of Japanese and American culture.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">自身か謙遜</p>

<p>アメリカでは自分に自信がある人が多いです。自分がほめられた時に悪い気持ちで返事をします。ほめられた人は相手に"私はあなたより幸せだし、お金を持っているから私の方がえらい"と返事をするのが普通です。だいたいその返事は相手をいやな気持ちにします。でも、アメリカには人と場合によってほめられた時の返事は違います。たとえば、"そのカバンは高そう"　とほめて、ほめられた人は"いいえ、あんまり高くなかった"と返事をすることが多いです。本当はそのカバンは高かった。</p>

<p>アメリカの歴史は自分に自信を持つことが大事です。日本の歴史では謙遜をすることが大事です。日本人は謙遜をすることが大切です。日本人はほめられた時には自分の悪いことを最初に言います。そしてかならず謙遜します。たとえば、カバンをほめらったとあんまり喜んだ返事をしません。自分のほめられたものの悪いてんを言います。なぜかと言うと謙遜しているからです。日本の文化は謙遜をすることを大切にしているからでしょう。</p>

<p>でも、謙遜をすることには問題も。日本人が面接の時に自信を持たないから、面接を落ちる可能性もあります。それに、日本人はいつも謙遜をしていますが、本当にしているのかがわかりません。</p>

<p>アメリカと日本の違いは自信を持つか謙遜をするか、ということでしょう。私にはどちらも大切だと思います。なぜかと言うと、自信を持つことも、謙遜することもバランスを持って、どう使うかを知れば良いと思います。友達と働くか、同僚と働くかのような違いです。</p>

<p><span>Reflection: These essays helped me improve my Japanese writing&nbsp;abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Description: Reading modern literary, journalistic, and expository writings.<br>
</span></p>

<p><span>Reflection: This course is by far the most difficult Japanese course I have ever taken. The readings are Japanese&nbsp;university&nbsp;level and are topics such as space&nbsp;technology,&nbsp;industrial&nbsp;revolution,&nbsp;death&nbsp;penalty,&nbsp;artificial&nbsp;insemination, and much more. From this course I gain problem solving skills when reading Japanese texts.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Artifact: This is my essay in Japanese about not judging a book by it's cover.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">本の見た目</p>

<p>アメリカは移住者の国である。本の見た目で判断しない方がいいと言うアメリカの言葉があります。その意味は、人は見た目よりもっと中身の方が大切ということです。アメリカの人口は種類豊富ですが、異文化交流の誤解が多いのは当然のことでしょう。人類は知らないことに恐れと防衛本能があると思います。アメリカにはこんな機会がたくさんあるでしょう。だから、簡単に人が人を裁かない方がいいと思います。</p>

<p>子供のときに友達が家に遊びに来た後に、母にその友達はいい人かどうか聞きました。常に母の答えは、始めて会ったのだから中身は良く知らないからいい人かどうか分からない、ということでした。母は否めない事実を言いました。つまり、人は初めて会うときだけで判断しない方がいいでしょう。その人の人となりを心得て、判断するのが いいでしょう。</p>

<p>留学したとき、「本の見た目」の事件が起きました。日本語の山下先生はとても気が強い人でした。生徒たちは恐怖で気も狂わんばかりでした。授業に行くとぞっとするような気持ちが強かったのです。ある日、突然あることに気がつきました。山下先生が厳しい理由は、怖く日本語を教えると生徒がよく覚えるからです。怒られるのが怖いから生徒たちはちゃんと勉強をすることでしょう。山下先生が生徒のことを考えてくれたので、生徒たちの日本語がよくなりました。学期の終わりにやっと山下先生の優しさが分かりました。思ったより、彼女の人となりは偉かったのです。</p>

<p>やはり、簡単に見た目だけで人を判断しない 方がいいでしょう。母の言ったことを考えて、山下先生の事件みたくその人を時間をかけて理解していきたいです。本の物語の意義は終わるまで知らない、人の裁くのも同じことでしょう。</p>

<p>Reflection: With using American phrases it is better to write them in kanagana then putting the phrase in Japanese with explanation. My professor did not understand the phrase because I used direct translation.&nbsp;</p>

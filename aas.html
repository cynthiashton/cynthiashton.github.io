<p>Since Fall 1969, the Asian American Studies (AAS) Department at San Francisco State University was established because of the 1968 Black Student Union/ Third World Liberation Front Student Strike. This minor provides further understanding of the histories and cultures of Asian Americans and their various identities, experiences, and communities. &nbsp;AAS uses interdisciplinary approach to address the structural and ideological forces that shape the lives if Asian Americans. This minor educated me with:</p>

<ul>
<li>An interdisciplinary understanding of histories, cultures, and radicalization of Asian Americans.</li>

<li>Concepts, critical theories, and methodologies to identify structural/ideological forces.</li>

<li>Skills &amp; Knowledge to acquire self-determination &amp; empowerment&nbsp;</li>

<li>Values of social justice, activism, equity, and respect for difference&nbsp;</li>

<li>Communication skills through construct evidence-based and persuasive oral/written arguments with proper citations/support from multiple forms of knowledge&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>This minor is a <strong>reflection of my American identity</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Comparative analysis of the experience of different Asian American groups and their place in the general history and development of American society.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This course evoked my critical reflection my experiences with United States History within my public education. The United States is a land of immigrants, yet within our public education narrative only includes those of white and black ethnic background. This course informed me that the United States is build on the blood and sweat of immigrants that go nameless.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Artifact: Oral History Project</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> This is a essay of my oral history project of my mother's experience immigrating to the U.S. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Dedicated to My Mother's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Open Minded America Yoshie Nakajima Ashton I interviewed my mother Yoshie Ashton is a sixty-year-old Japanese immigrant who first immigrated to United States in 1981 from Japan and she lived in the United States since 1991. She got married in 1981 to Barton Ashton. She never applied for her American citizenship, and currently is a permanent alien residence with a green card. Her husband past away on June 4, 2004. She raised three children on her own. Currently she works as a house keeper and lives happily with her six cats. Yoshie Nakajima grew up in an era of rapid modernization and a shift within Japanese culture itself. Yoshie was born on April 25, 1952; 7 years after World War II. She grew up in an era of strong influences of Western Culture, and in particular American culture. The Surrender of the Japan Empire lead to the nation's loss of an Emperor along with their military forces. The belief of the living god, the Emperor, brought together over 3,000 islands. Modernization of Japan began with Emperor Meiji in which gave birth to Japan's imperial navy. The people of Japan believed in the emperor, the divine living god. Once it was revealed that he is not a deity, many new religions and cults sprung about in the nation. Japan was stripped of their all mighty navy which ruled Asia. On top of all that, Japan went through a rapid modernization of the industry, culture, and daily living. "I remember when I was 6. The roads were dirt. The morning sky was clear and fresh, and the night sky was dark and filled with bright shining stars. By the time when I was 8 years old… the roads were concrete… the morning sky was cloudy with pollution, and the night sky was filled with street lights and no star could be seen" (Ashton, Yoshie). Yoshie witnessed modernity from birth. The intense political and economical climate which gave birth to the new modern Japan as many of us know it today. From an early age, Yoshie's mother would tell stories of World War II. Yoshie's mother was very strict on her growing up, which made her into a proper and respected Japanese women. Yoshie's mother always preached about how nothing good comes from war. "The most vivid story I remember is when my mother was a student in high school she was forced to work for a factory. Walking to the factory in Tokyo, there were lots of B-29 planes flying bombing Japan. She would walk to the factory and see human carcass everywhere on the streets, telephone poles, just everywhere" (Ashton, Yoshie). Yoshie grew up in believing in harmony and peace, along with listening to The Beatles. "Okasan, are you a hippie?" "I am, but not the fashion." Yoshie is a very different kind of Japanese, she loves her home land Japan yet she chooses to live away from it in California. Being her daughter, I never understood this. She always spoke so highly about her home land, and often complains about American mannerism. Then I asked her "Why didn't you want to live in Japan?" She replied "Japan is so close minded; they only believe that life has only one answer. But life isn't just black and white. In life, and with anything and everything, there is more than one answer. One isn't better than the other, one isn't more right; they are all different and beautiful in their own way. I didn't like seeing women being treated so badly in Japan, and I didn't like being told to live life the 'right' way. Japan at that time was so conservative" (Ashton, Yoshie). Yoshie grew up during the hippie era of the talks of love and peace. Her love for Western music and culture lead to her love for Western men. "Since middle school I knew I wanted to marry a Western man" (Ashton, Yoshie). When Yoshie first moved to San Francisco in January 1981 she got married in the same year in April. Although her husband Barton was a White American, he didn't know the San Francisco Bay Area well enough to assist Yoshie with her needs such as schooling to perfect her broken English. "It's hard to find out about anything because, you know it's not like now where you can just look it up on Google" (Ashton, Yoshie). Yoshie found a really good English School in San Francisco, which many Vietnamese were also enrolled at. She scored very high on the entrance exam, yet Barton insisted that they moved to Castro Valley, across the Bay Bridge. "My teacher from San Francisco was really upset that I was leaving and she told me good luck. At the time I wondered why she told me good luck. I went to adult school in Castro Valley it was really bad school I didn't learn anything. I couldn't go to Chabot Community College because daddy didn't do the taxes. So I was stuck at adult school and didn't learn anything. Daddy told me to just work, and I didn't know what do to so I just went to Japan town in San Francisco and worked for the newspaper company and designed advertisement. If I just commuted to that school in San Francisco I would have learned English perfectly and probably was able to get a good job and actually did things that I wanted to do. Instead of cleaning houses and working under the table" (Ashton, Yoshie). Yoshie had a hard time finding good work because of the language barrier. Along with her husband, who didn't help her in ways that would have let her exceed well in life of the Americas. "I should have listened to my mother; she told me that daddy will make my life difficult. She said when you cross a river you should step on every stone and take your time, but people like daddy try to take short cuts and makes life difficult" (Ashton, Yoshie). Yoshie's husband, Barton Ashton, was a Vice President of his step-father's import company that was stationed in Tokyo. One evening, Barton got very drunk and got into an argument with his step-father who was the CEO and President of the company. Barton quit his job and soon after Yoshie, the eldest daughter Charlene, 6 years-old, the only son Kento, 4 years old, and myself the youngest who was 11 months old moved to Castro Valley, California. Charlene and Kento had a difficult time assimilating into American schools because of the language barrier. Barton worked for a moving company for a few years then quit and fell into depression. Yoshie cleaned houses under the table along with working as a lunch lady at Hayward High School, where she faced much discrimination. Barton was an alcoholic who had diabetes and suffered from depression from childhood trauma. In 2003 they began filing for divorce, and on June 4, 2004 Barton Ashton was found dead in his kitchen apartment. Yoshie worked four jobs, cleaning houses under the table, serving lunch at Hayward High, working as a sale associate at Daiso, and house keeping for Octopus Holdings. Yoshie knew that the reason why her husband was so unhappy is because he was never given the chance to do what he wanted to do. Barton wanted to be a chef, but his family forced him into the salary-man life. Because of this, Yoshie always told her children to be whoever they wished to be and do what they have a passion for. Yoshie has a beautiful perspective of life. She doesn't believe that life is black and white, rather it is entirely gray. She witnessed the modernization of Japan, she heard the stories of war, she listened to the music of peace, she made her bad choices, but most importantly she never gave up. If you ever get to have a conversation with Yoshie, you can feel her warmth, sincerity, sweetness and cuteness. I asked Yoshie "What's one thing you want people to remember you by?'" she replied with one word "Kindness".</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> This course focuses on the Japanese American character, identity, self-image, and behavioral manifestations of the interaction of American and Japanese cultural values.</p>

<p><br>
 <strong>Reflection:</strong> This course brought enlightenment of the struggle of Japanese Americans. Growing up in many Japanese American communities, I experience many negative experience because of being biracial. From this class I learned to forgive and forget those negative experience because I understand the context of the Japanese American Experience.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Professor Wesley Ueunten is doing an exhibit at the National Japanese American Historical Society on the Okinawan Experience during World War II. The assignment is to put on an exhibit of research. I chose my topic of&nbsp;Half Breeds in the Bay Area: Fusion of Relevance. This assignment was thorough and involve interview over 17 multiracial persons and their experience of being multiracial in the U.S. By far, <strong>this is one of my greatest achievements in my undergrad</strong>. Please read this paper!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This paper allowed me to conduct interviews and make critical analysis of the term "American." In my opinion, being multiracial is similar to being interdisciplinarian.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Historical, social, and cultural influences that impact the identities of Filipina/o Americans through a framework of decolonization.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This course allow me to compare and contrast the differences and similarities to heritage land &nbsp;Filipinos and United States Filipinos. The impact of American capitalism and dehumanization of the Philippines is reflective within current American society. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Artifact: Filipino Americanization&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><span><strong>Description:</strong> This paper is an analysis of identities of Filipino Americans and their ties to the homeland.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Filipino Americanized or Filipino American</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Historically, immigration patterns of people of color, with regards to immigrant identity, are dependent on geographical space and the era in which they immigrated.&nbsp; Out of the Asian American experiences the Filipino American experience is quite unique because of their history with the U.S. that greatly impact one's "Filipino-ness." First and second generation Filipino Americans carry different homeland ties along with the differences of assimilation of American culture, which causes one to question of his "Filipino-ness" within their identity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closeness to the values of the homeland impacts the way a Filipino American views their identity. The colonization of the Philippines by Spain in the 15<sup>th</sup> century and then the colonization by the U.S. in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century impacted the identity of the homeland (32-33, Bonus).The indigenous Filipinos had already transformed their identity because of colonization. Because of the colonization of the U.S. the Philippines adopted values of education and adapted their nation to become more modernized (33, Bonus). The colonization of the Philippines creates even more confusion and results in the questioning of the identity of a Filipino American. First generation Filipinos have a closer relationship with the homeland than second generation Filipinos. Hierarchy of "Filipino-ness" causes some to believe that "I am not Filipino enough". Of course living in the U.S., attending&nbsp; American schools and working in the U.S. one can not help but adapt to the American culture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assimilating into American culture is the result of discrimination within the Filipino's new so-called home.&nbsp; This remark by a Filipino American shows how he feels unwelcomed,&nbsp; "Many people think of us as foreigners or, sometimes, even strangers and visitors" (51,Bonus). Although a Filipino American has U.S citizenship&nbsp; because of there appearance and occasionally accented English the dominant ethnicity is fearful of the Filipino American. Discrimination caused Filipinos to consume more American culture in hopes of lessening racism acted upon&nbsp; them. Bonus states that "...for instance, [Filipinos] have chosen to speak to their children in English exclusively to protect them from possibly being maltreated in school and other public places" (53, Bonus).&nbsp; The parents of the second generation Filipinos are attempting to protect their children from racism by making them more Americanized. Yet even Americanized Ben is discriminated against because he looks Asian.&nbsp; When Ben is at a primarily white party he is accused of "eating dog" and being a "chink" (The Debut). This "shared experiences of racism" brought the Filipino American communities together (53, Bonus). In the Filipino community, Filipino Americans can compare and contrast themselves with other Filipino Americans on "how Filipino" one is. For example in the film, Ben and Rose are both second generation Filipino. Rose is able to speak some Tagalog yet Ben does not even know how to "bless" (The Debut). This shows the dissuasive-ness of the Filipino culture within just a generation. Living in the U.S., attending American schooling and working in the U.S. Ben can not help but adapt to the American culture in which the Filipino culture thins out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to Bonus "...Filipino American identity... [have a] complex array of Filipino American ethnicity over time and space" (55, Bonus).&nbsp; Formation of identity&nbsp; is constructed thru the ties of the homeland and the impact of American assimilation. At the same time one may carry complicated feelings of pride of shamefulness like Ben, when he kicks his friends out of his house because it is too "ethnic" (The Debut). Within just one generation gap the identity of a Filipino American constantly is in question of "how Filipino are you?"&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><strong>Reflection:</strong> The impacts of colonization and it's trauma is still a current affair. The importance of decolonization in order to the community to regain self-worth, culture, and pride.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Literary works with Asian American themes that are written for the young (preschool to middle school). How Asian Americans are depicted from the 19th century to the present in this literature.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Representation of minorities within children's literature molds our youth's perception of one another. From this course I gain sensitivity on which story books to select based on critical analysis of literature in relations to injustice representation of minority groups. I gain skills on conveying respect for people and their ideas.&nbsp;</p>
